# Reliable Data Transfer with Sliding Window Protocol using UDP in C

This project involves implementing a client-server application in C that utilizes a Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) protocol and a sliding window mechanism. The client is responsible for sending a user-entered string to the server over UDP

The server takes one parameter, the port number it will listen on. To run the server, use the following command: ./server <port_number>

The client takes two parameters: the IP address of the server and the port number of the server. To run the client, use the following command: ./client <server_ip> <server_port>

Ensure the project is compiled and built using the provided makefile.
